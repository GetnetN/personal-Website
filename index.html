        <h1 style="text-align: justify; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Dear Reader ... </h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Cambria, serif;">
          I am <strong>Getnet Tigabie Askale</strong>, a Computer Science Lecturer at the University of Gondar, Ethiopia, where I have been serving since 2022. I hold both BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Science, and my academic career is driven by a strong commitment to teaching, research, and the application of computing to real-world challenges. Over the years, I have built a professional profile that combines excellence in education, innovative research, and practical software development skills.

In my teaching role, I deliver undergraduate courses in computer science and related fields while supervising student research and senior projects. I also contribute to curriculum design and program accreditation processes, ensuring that academic standards align with both national and global expectations. I believe in creating an engaging and supportive learning environment that encourages students to become independent thinkers and problem solvers.

My research focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Image Processing, and Natural Language Processing. I am particularly passionate about developing AI-powered systems that address pressing challenges in agriculture, health, and education. For example, my work on plant disease detection using deep learning has practical applications in improving crop productivity and food security, while my studies in skin disease classification and medical image analysis contribute to advancements in healthcare technologies.

I have published several works in reputable journals and conferences, including studies on maize disease detection, multi-class plant disease recognition, and skin disease classification using deep learning approaches. These publications reflect not only my research expertise but also my commitment to solving problems that have direct social and economic impacts. By blending theoretical knowledge with practical applications, my research aims to produce results that can be implemented in real-world contexts.

In addition to my research, I bring strong software engineering and web development skills to both academic and professional projects. I have hands-on experience in building software systems and interactive applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, AJAX, and other modern technologies. These skills complement my research by allowing me to translate theoretical findings into deployable solutions.

Beyond teaching and research, I actively engage in academic services, such as supervising final-year projects, reviewing scholarly works, and contributing to departmental development initiatives. I hold the Higher Diploma Programme (HDP) Certificate in Teaching Methods from the University of Gondar and completed the Master Class for Teaching Online (Open edX), which has strengthened my ability to deliver high-quality instruction in both traditional and digital environments.

Ultimately, my vision is to continue advancing in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science research, while mentoring students to become innovators and leaders in technology. I am driven by the belief that computing has the power to transform societies, and I am dedicated to contributing to both the academic community and the broader technological development of Ethiopia and beyond.
